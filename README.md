# JoyCon2 Connector

> A fork of [joycon2cpp](https://github.com/original/joycon2cpp) — with a fully rewritten GUI, improved optical mouse support, and seamless Switch 2 controller support on PC.

![Dashboard](https://s41.ax1x.com/2026/03/01/peSTU8s.png)

---

## What's New in This Fork

- **New GUI** — Replaces the original command-line interface with a clean, modern graphical UI.

-  **Improved Mouse Mode** — Supports the right Joy-Con 2's optical sensor as a PC mouse. Press the **CHAT button** to cycle through mouse modes (High / Medium / Low sensitivity + Off). Sensitivity and scroll speed can be adjusted in the mouse settings page. Interpolated input is added for smoother cursor movement.

-  **GL/GR Back Button Mapping** — Supports custom mappings for the Pro Controller 2's back buttons. Multiple named layouts can be created and switched on the fly during gameplay.

-  **Multi-language Support** — UI supports switching between Chinese and English (language button in the bottom-left corner).

-  **Multiple Controller Support** — Supports Joy-Con 2, Pro Controller 2, and NSO GameCube controllers.

-  **Gyro Support** — Supports emulated gyro input for compatible games and emulators.

## DISCLAIMER

This project is **Windows-only**. The virtual controller output relies on the `ViGEmBus` driver, which is exclusive to Windows. You're welcome to fork this for macOS/Linux if you'd like to tackle that.

---

## Dependencies

Before running the app, make sure these are installed:

- [ViGEmBus Driver](https://github.com/ViGEm/ViGEmBus/releases/latest)
- [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable 2015–2022 (x64)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist)

---

## How to Use

1. **Download and launch** the executable from the [Releases](../../releases) page (or build from source — see below).
2. Go to **Add Device** in the sidebar and select your controller type:
   - Single Joy-Con
   - Dual Joy-Con (paired L + R)
   - Pro Controller
   - NSO GameCube Controller
3. Follow the on-screen steps — you'll be prompted to specify Left/Right for single Joy-Cons, or pair them one at a time for dual mode.
4. Once connected, your controller appears on the **Dashboard** as a virtual DS4/Xbox gamepad, ready to use in any PC game.

### Mouse Mode (Right Joy-Con 2 only)

The right Joy-Con 2's optical sensor can act as a PC mouse. Press the **CHAT button** to cycle through three mouse modes (high / medium / low sensitivity) or turn it off. Sensitivity and scroll speed can be tuned in the **Mouse Settings** page.

### Back Button Layout (Pro Controller 2)

Go to **Back Button Layout** to assign GL and GR to any button input. You can create multiple named layouts and switch between them mid-game by pressing **C**, or open the layout manager with **ZL + ZR + GL + GR**.

---

## Building from Source

### Requirements

Install the following via the **Visual Studio Installer**:

- Visual Studio 2022 or newer
- Workload: **Desktop development with C++**
- Component: **Windows 10 or 11 SDK**
- Component: **MSVC v14.x**

### Steps

1. Open the **x64 Native Tools Command Prompt** for your Visual Studio version.

2. Navigate to the `joycon2_connector` directory and create a build folder:
   ```sh
   cd joycon2_connector
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

3. Generate Visual Studio project files:
   ```sh
   cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64
   ```

4. Build in Release mode:
   ```sh
   cmake --build . --config Release
   ```

5. The compiled executable will be at:
   ```
   build\Release\joycon2_connector.exe
   ```

---

## Troubleshooting

**Controller stops connecting after multiple attempts:**
This is a known controller-level cooldown behavior — not an OS or Bluetooth stack issue. Simply wait a few minutes and try again.

**ViGEm not detected:**
Make sure the ViGEmBus driver is installed *before* launching the app. The status indicator on the Dashboard will show green when it's connected.

**Bit layouts differ between Left and Right Joy-Cons**, so always select the correct side during setup.

## BLE Protocol Notes

<details>
<summary>Joy-Con 2 BLE Notification Layout (click to expand)</summary>

This section documents the raw BLE notification format for Joy-Con 2, useful if you're developing or reverse-engineering controller input.

> Huge thanks to [@german77](https://github.com/german77) for providing the notification layout.

### Example Notification (Left Joy-Con 2, IMU enabled)

```
08670000000000e0ff0ffff77f23287a0000000000000000000000000000005f0e007907000000000001ce7b52010500beffb501ee0ffeff04000200000000
```

### Notes

- Left Joy-Con does not use the Right Stick — data at `0x0B–0x0D` is junk.
- Stick values use 12-bit X/Y packed across 3 bytes.
- Accel/Gyro are signed 16-bit integers.
- Temperature formula: `25 + (raw / 127)` — e.g. `raw = 3679` → ~54°C
- Battery voltage is in millivolts — `3000` = 3.0V; `0x0000` means unavailable.
- Pro Controller 2 and GC Controller notifications follow a similar layout with some field shifts.
